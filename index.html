              <p>
                The Falling Sand Simulator is an interactive web-based
                simulation built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows
                users to draw and manipulate sand particles on a canvas, with
                features like color picking, adjustable brush sizes, and a
                rainbow mode for dynamic effects.
              </p>
              <p>
                I worked on this project to experiment with the HTML canvas and
                how to create

              <p>
                I worked on this project to experiment with how vscode
                extensions are made and how they work, also exploring the vscode
                API. This is just a

              <h3>Professional Experience & Skills</h3>

              <p>
                I'm a junior backend developer with experience in building and
                optimizing web applications. I have worked with NestJS and
                Prisma to develop backend services, manage databases using
                PostgreSQL, and implement RESTful APIs with authentication and
                authorization.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                I have a good understanding of TypeScript, Git workflows, and
                writing unit tests with Jest. I also document APIs using Swagger
                and follow best practices to keep my code organized and
                maintainable. Through my work at SlashHub, I have gained
                experience in e-commerce platforms, order management systems,
                and integrating payment gateways like Geidea.
              </p>
              <br />
              <h3>Professional Interests</h3>
              <p>
                I'm a Computer Science student at Cairo University with a strong
                interest in backend development, low-level programming, system
                programming, and operating systems. Beyond my studies, I'm
                actively working on expanding my knowledge in these areas.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                One of my goals is to contribute to open-source projects, and
                Iâ€™ve started by working on simple issues in the
                <a href="https://github.com/mdn/content" target="_blank"
                  >MDN Content repository</a
                >. Iâ€™m also eager to explore building scalable systems that can
                serve millions of users.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, I want to dive deeper into OS development and
                system programming to better understand the machine I work with
                daily. If I find it exciting, I might even pursue it as a
                career. Another area Iâ€™d love to explore is compiler
                developmentâ€”learning how they work and how to build them.
              </p>
              <br />
              <h3>Beyond Tech</h3>
              <p>
                Iâ€™m a huge movie lover! Sci-fi and dystopian films are my
                favorites, but I enjoy all genres. I appreciate movies that
                challenge my thinking, broaden my perspective, and even teach me
                something new. To me, cinema and art are essential because they
                help us understand the world in unique ways.
              </p>
              <p>
                My favorite movie is <strong>Arrival</strong> â€” it changed my
                perspective on language and communication. The idea that
                language is more than just words and sounds fascinated me, and
                the soundtrack is simply breathtaking!
